          <h2>Methods</h2>

              <h3>Pre-Processing Data</h3>
              <p>
                We have chosen to work with the DigIC dataset that we received last 
                quarter from our mentors. When pre-processing our data, we generate the 
                connectivity graph to be passed into our model. The DigIC dataset 
                provides us with connectivity data as an incidence matrix, so we use 
                that to generate the connectivity graph. Next, we split the data into 
                training and validation sets. \cite{congestionnet} partition the graph 
                by function for generalization purposes; however, we pivot from this 
                method, as our data is not provided to us by function. Instead, we split 
                our data randomly into 70\% training and 30\% validation. We concluded 
                that a random split would be the most efficient for our purposes, since 
                it reduces dependencies within nodes. Finally, we define congestion as 
                routing capacity subtracted from the total routing demand in a global 
                routing cell (GRC). A GRC is a representation of a chip in a 2-D space, 
                which is then divided into blocks or regions, each defined as a GRC. 
                Each GRC contains a number of nodes and wires, which helps us to 
                understand the netlist on a local perspective. Our definition of 
                congestion, because we are generalizing individual nodes to a GRC with 
                multiple nodes, can be limiting, but is overall a sufficient method to 
                efficiently differentiate congestion levels by region.

              <h3>Our Model</h3>
              <p>
                We employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) tailored to the intricacies of 
                VLSI design to predict congestion. A GNN is a form of artificial neural 
                network used to capture graph-structured data, and are useful in tasks 
                such as node classification, link prediction, and graph-level prediction. 
                In particular, we focus on the eight layer Graph Attention Network (GAT) 
                architecture proposed by \cite{congestionnet} in “CongestionNet: Routing 
                Congestion Prediction Using Deep Graph Neural Networks”. The GAT model 
                originates from \cite{gat}, and is a variant of the GNN. GATs have an 
                additional attention layer, which assigns attention scores for nodes and 
                their neighbors, resulting in a weighted message passing for important 
                nodes. This weighted feature allows for a more complex and nuanced 
                understanding of graph data, with local and global routing representations. 
                This method stood out as one that seemed both fast and effective, 
                utilizing the topological properties of circuit data to make quick, 
                accurate predictions.<br>
                We are using normalized xloc, normalized yloc, instance pin count, GRC pin 
                count, GRC cell count, normalized height, and normalized width as our 
                features. These not only intuitively and make sense in affecting the demand 
                of routing wires in a GRC, we also use Pearson correlation coefficient to 
                validate our decision of utilizing these features in our model. In this 
                paper, we have decided to employ congestion as the sum of congestion values 
                for each GRC across all of the layers. This congestion value is then 
                assigned to each node in the GRC. Although each area of the GRC does not 
                have exactly the same value of congestion, this simplifies the process and 
                is time-efficient for our purposes of generalizing to each GRC.

              <h3>Testing</h3>
              <p>
                We will be assessing our model's effectiveness by comparing it to both 
                other approaches taken on the DigIC data as well as the Kendall correlation 
                numbers in the paper. Kendall correlation works well with large sample sizes 
                as well as data with outliers. This way, we can assess both the 
                effectiveness of the model relative to other methods as well as the 
                generalizability of the model on datasets not used by \cite{congestionnet}.<br>
                In addition to the assessment of the effectiveness of the CongestionNet 
                approach, we will implement an explainability component in our project. 
                After thoroughly working with our model, we hope to be able to look at 
                different circuits we used in the dataset to infer and explain some of the 
                shortcomings in the model. We will attempt to find connections between our 
                extracted features and functions of the circuits beforehand and the theory 
                behind the GAT. In addition to this, we propose a simple ablation study, 
                where we take out some of the features that we use to assess their 
                importance to model performance.
