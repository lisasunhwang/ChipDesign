**Question 1** <br>
* The most interesting topic we covered in our domain this quarter was the concept of embeddings; it is interesting that an entire graph's structure and nodes can be encapsulated by a simple format.

**Question 2** <br>
* A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project would be optimization of timing in placement/routing of gates.

**Question 3** <br>
* A potential change to my current Quarter 1 Project would be to reproduce the experiment we are looking at on a smaller scale rather than a larger scale. How is the functionality improved/worsened by decreasing the scale?

**Question 4** <br>
* I would be interested in learning more about message passing techniques to implement in congestion optimization.
